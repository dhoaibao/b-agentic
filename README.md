# b-agentic

**An agentic workflow harness for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex CLI, and Antigravity CLI.**

`b-agentic` is a behavioral harness, not a skill suite. A runtime kernel enforces routing, safety gates, evidence standards, and handoff contracts. Skills are phase owners that execute within that envelope: clarify, plan, build, validate, debug, review, and ship. Claude Code is the reference runtime; OpenCode, Codex CLI, and Antigravity CLI are supported through runtime-specific adapters.

Skill names are runtime-neutral: Claude Code, OpenCode, and Antigravity CLI commonly expose `/b-*`, while Codex CLI uses `/skills`, `$skill-name`, or implicit matching.

## Install

Default install for Claude Code:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash
```

Install for OpenCode:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --runtime=opencode
```

Install for Codex CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --runtime=codex-cli
```

Install for Antigravity CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --runtime=antigravity-cli
```

Install for all registered runtimes:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --runtime=all
```

Codex CLI config merge uses Python 3.11+ standard-library TOML parsing.

Useful flags:

- `--runtime=all` to install the default runtime set or uninstall across every runtime in `runtimes/registry.yaml`
- `--dry-run` to preview changes
- `--replace-memory` to replace an existing managed kernel file
- `--uninstall` to remove managed files

Re-run the installer to update.

The installer writes only to user-scope runtime locations. It does not create `.b-agentic/` or `.b-agentic/.gitignore` in the current repo just because you run install from inside a git worktree.

## One Command

The installer is designed to be a one-command bootstrap. It installs the kernel, syncs skills, writes runtime templates, and prints numbered stage progress followed by a short `Summary`, `Readiness`, `Shell tooling`, and `Next steps` report so you can see what changed without reading installer internals. The shell-tooling section includes a default core tier for `rg`, `fd`/`fdfind`, `jq`, `tmux`, and `fzf`, plus a separate optional tier for `bat`/`batcat`, `yq`, `git-delta`, and `gh`. When the installer can detect Homebrew, `apt`, or `dnf`, it prints matching package commands for both tiers. The installer never auto-installs those packages.

## What You Get

- A runtime kernel installed into the active tool: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, or `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`
- The `b-agentic` skill set under the runtime-local skills tree (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, or `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`)
- Recommended runtime config templates, MCP config, and shared references
- For OpenCode, thin `/b-*` command wrappers in `~/.config/opencode/commands/`
- For Codex CLI, skill registration and MCP server config in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- For Antigravity CLI, `/b-*` commands exposed by installed Antigravity skills in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/`

If an existing kernel file is preserved, the install stays in a pending state until you replace or merge it.

## Skills

The table below is generated from `skills/registry.yaml`.

<!-- generated:skills-table:start -->
| Skill | Phase | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `b-orchestrate` | End-to-end | Coordinate resumed phase handoffs until PR-ready, ready with follow-ups, or blocked |
| `b-plan` | Decide | Clarify unclear goals or turn a clear goal into an execution plan |
| `b-research` | Decide | Fetch external docs, API facts, comparisons, or recent evidence |
| `b-implement` | Build | Execute approved plans or small direct requests |
| `b-refactor` | Build | Rename, extract, move, inline, simplify, or delete behavior-preserving code |
| `b-debug` | Validate | Confirm runtime root cause and fix minimally |
| `b-test` | Validate | Write or fix unit, integration, contract, and simulated-DOM tests |
| `b-browser` | Validate | Collect real-browser, visual, screenshot, live UI, or e2e evidence |
| `b-review` | Validate | Review changed code or run a b-agentic suite self-audit |
| `b-ship` | Ship | Commit, push, and open a PR on explicit request after review readiness |
<!-- generated:skills-table:end -->

Typical flow:

```text
b-orchestrate [workflow request] -> handoff/status across resumed turns
b-plan [goal] -> approve plan -> b-implement -> b-test -> b-review
b-browser [UI/e2e verification]
b-research [external docs or recent info]
b-debug [runtime bug]
b-refactor [behavior-preserving change]
b-ship [explicit ship request after review readiness]
```

`b-orchestrate` coordinates via handoff envelopes and returned status blocks; it does not auto-run every phase inside one invocation. Operators resume the next phase with a new explicit invocation. `b-ship` remains explicit even when another skill closes with `Next: b-ship`.

## Source Of Truth

- `skills/registry.yaml` and `skills/*/prompt.md` define the skill surface
- `runtimes/registry.yaml` and `references/contract/kernel.template.md` define runtime behavior
- `tooling/generate/registry_sync.py` regenerates committed delivery assets
- `scripts/validate-skills.sh` is the main shared validation entrypoint; use `scripts/validate-skills.sh --release` when delivery changes must also pass installer smoke coverage
- `scripts/smoke-install.sh` remains the standalone smoke entrypoint when you need the installer suite by itself
- `tooling/validate/` contains the shared validation harness
- `tests/smoke/` contains the shared smoke harness
- `runtimes/runtime-template/` is the scaffold for a new runtime adapter

## Docs

- `CLAUDE.md` is the maintainer guide for this source repo
- `references/contract/` contains the detailed runtime contract
- `runtimes/<name>/configs/README.md` describes runtime-specific layout details
