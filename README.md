# b-agentic

**An agent workflow kernel for Claude Code and OpenCode.**

`b-agentic` turns rough developer intent into disciplined loops: clarify, plan, build, validate, debug, review, and ship. Claude Code is the reference runtime; OpenCode is supported through a bridge adapter that keeps the same `/b-*` skill surface available.

## Install

Default install for Claude Code:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash
```

Install for OpenCode:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhoaibao/b-agentic/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --runtime=opencode
```

Useful flags:

- `--dry-run` to preview changes
- `--replace-memory` to replace an existing managed kernel file
- `--uninstall` to remove managed files

Re-run the installer to update.

The installer writes only to user-scope runtime locations. It does not create `.b-agentic/` or `.b-agentic/.gitignore` in the current repo just because you run install from inside a git worktree.

## One Command

The installer is designed to be a one-command bootstrap. It installs the kernel, syncs skills, writes runtime templates, and prints a short result summary with fields such as `skillsSynced` so you can see what changed without reading installer internals.

## What You Get

- A runtime kernel installed into the active tool: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`
- The `b-agentic` skill set under `~/.claude/skills/`
- Recommended runtime config templates, MCP config, and shared references
- For OpenCode, thin `/b-*` command wrappers in `~/.config/opencode/commands/`

If an existing kernel file is preserved, the install stays in a pending state until you replace or merge it.

## Skills

The table below is generated from `skills/registry.yaml`.

<!-- generated:skills-table:start -->
| Skill | Phase | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `/b-orchestrate` | End-to-end | Coordinate phase handoffs until PR-ready, ready with follow-ups, or blocked |
| `/b-plan` | Decide | Clarify unclear goals or turn a clear goal into an execution plan |
| `/b-research` | Decide | Fetch external docs, API facts, comparisons, or recent evidence |
| `/b-implement` | Build | Execute approved plans or small direct requests |
| `/b-refactor` | Build | Rename, extract, move, inline, simplify, or delete behavior-preserving code |
| `/b-debug` | Validate | Confirm runtime root cause and fix minimally |
| `/b-test` | Validate | Write or fix unit, integration, contract, and simulated-DOM tests |
| `/b-browser` | Validate | Collect real-browser, visual, screenshot, live UI, or e2e evidence |
| `/b-review` | Validate | Review changed code for blockers, regressions, security, and coverage |
| `/b-audit` | Validate | Audit the b-agentic suite for systemic risk (suite-only) |
| `/b-ship` | Ship | Commit, push, and open a PR after READY FOR PR |
<!-- generated:skills-table:end -->

Typical flow:

```text
/b-orchestrate [feature/fix request]
/b-plan [goal] -> approve plan -> /b-implement -> /b-test -> /b-review
/b-browser [UI/e2e verification]
/b-research [external docs or recent info]
/b-debug [runtime bug]
/b-refactor [behavior-preserving change]
/b-ship [commit, push, open PR]
```

## Source Of Truth

- `skills/registry.yaml` and `skills/*/prompt.md` define the skill surface
- `runtimes/registry.yaml` and `references/contract/kernel.template.md` define runtime behavior
- `tooling/generate/registry_sync.py` regenerates committed delivery assets
- `scripts/validate-skills.sh` and `scripts/smoke-install.sh` are the main verification entrypoints
- `tooling/validate/` contains the shared validation harness
- `tests/smoke/` contains the shared smoke harness
- `runtimes/runtime-template/` is the scaffold for a new runtime adapter

## Docs

- `CLAUDE.md` is the maintainer guide for this source repo
- `references/contract/` contains the detailed runtime contract
- `runtimes/claude-code/configs/README.md` and `runtimes/opencode/configs/README.md` describe runtime-specific layout details
